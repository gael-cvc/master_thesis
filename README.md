## Abstract
Artificial Intelligence has profoundly transformed content creation, enabling machines to generate text, images, and videos with human-level quality. While these advancements unlock significant opportunities across industries, they also raise growing concerns regarding misuse—particularly in education, journalism, and intellectual property.
This research investigates how different algorithms can reliably detect AI-generated content. It begins with a comprehensive review of existing literature on AI content creation and detection techniques, examining statistical, machine learning, and hybrid approaches. The study also explores the legal and ethical implications of AI-generated media, including challenges related to authorship, academic integrity, privacy, and information reliability.
Building on this analysis, the thesis benchmarks current AI detection tools and evaluates their performance using established metrics. Finally, it proposes a comprehensive AI content detection framework, assessing its theoretical potential and practical applicability in real-world scenarios. The objective is to contribute to the development of more robust, scalable, and ethically grounded detection systems capable of adapting to the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

## Problem statement
The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content presents both significant opportunities and serious challenges. While generative AI enables new forms of creativity and scalable content production, it simultaneously raises concerns regarding authenticity, plagiarism, and content integrity. These concerns are particularly critical in domains such as education and journalism, where distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated content is essential to maintaining trust and credibility.
Despite the growing number of detection tools, many existing techniques remain surface-level and vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated AI systems. As generative models continue to evolve, detection mechanisms often struggle to generalize across new architectures, modalities, and adversarial modifications.
This research addresses the pressing need to evaluate the effectiveness of current state-of-the-art AI detection systems across different forms of content, including text and other AI-generated media. It seeks to analyze existing generation and detection architectures, benchmark their performance, and identify their limitations.
Furthermore, the study proposes a methodological framework for improving AI-generated content detection. This framework combines technical detection tools with human expertise and outlines a scalable model design capable of identifying synthetic content within diverse datasets. By synthesizing insights from existing research on AI content generation and detection, this work aims to contribute to the development of more robust, adaptable, and reliable detection systems.

## Methodology
This research is grounded in the fields of digital forensics and information security, addressing thegrowing challenge of detecting AI-generated text in academic contexts. As advanced language models such as GPT-4 produce increasingly human-like outputs, preserving academic integrity requires robust and scalable detection mechanisms.

**Research Philosophy**: The study follows a pragmatic and positivist approach, aiming to develop practical, deployable solutions for real-world academic environments. It adopts a deductive reasoning framework, beginning with hypotheses about AI-generated text detection and validating them through systematic experimentation and quantitative evaluation.
Performance is assessed using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure objective and generalizable findings.

**Benchmarking and Evaluation**: A benchmarking analysis of leading AI content detection tools is conducted to evaluate their strengths, weaknesses, and methodological approaches. This comparative assessment identifies current limitations and informs the design of an improved detection framework.
By combining theoretical foundations with empirical validation, the methodology bridges research and practice, supporting the development of reliable AI-generated content detection systems.
